# Python Data Structures

## Description
This project demonstrates the use of Python data structures such as lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples through a console application. It includes modular implementations for each data structure and unit tests to ensure correctness. The project is designed to be a learning resource for understanding Python's built-in data structures and their operations.

## Project Structure

## Key Files
- **`src/main.py`**: The entry point of the application. Demonstrates operations on lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples.
- **`src/data_structures/`**: Contains modular implementations for each data structure:
  - `dictionaries.py`: Functions for adding, removing, and retrieving dictionary entries.
  - `lists.py`: Functions for adding, removing, and iterating over list elements.
  - `sets.py`: Functions for set operations like union, intersection, and difference.
  - `tuples.py`: Functions for creating and accessing tuple elements.
- **`tests/`**: Contains unit tests for all data structure modules using the `unittest` framework.

## Usage
1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd python-data-structures-app
